# German Categorized Wordlist

This project contains categorized German words in seperated text files.

Experimental version [v1](v1) is ready now, but excluded [gennum](tools/gennum) outputs
due to huge size. If you need them, then you can generate numbers in text with our 
[gennum tool](tools/gennum) from 0 to 999999.
